{: .prompt-tip}

- **Customer-provider** relationship
  - The **customer** **pays** its **provider** for access to the rest of the Internet
- **Peer-to-peer** relationship
  - The two peers find it **mutually advantageous** to exchange traffic between their respective customers;
  - typically, peers exchange a roughly **even amount** of traffic **free** of charge
- **Sibling-to-sibling** relationship
  - The two siblings under **common** ownership or control **exchange** traffic between their respective customers, providers, and peers **without** the exchange of **payment**

**Customer-provider** relationship translates into the following export policy rules:

> In exchanging routing information **with** a **provider**, an **AS** can **export** **its** routes **and** **its customer routes**, but usually does **not export its provider or peer routes**.
{: .prompt-info}

**Provider-customer** relationship translates into the following export policy rules:

> In exchanging routing information **with** a **customer** an **AS** can **export its** routes **and its customer routes**, **as well as** its **provider** and **peer** routes.
{: .prompt-info}

**Peer-to-peer** relationship translates into the following export policy rules:

> In exchanging routing information **with** a **peer**, an **AS** can **export** **its** routes **and its customer routes**, but usually does **not** export its **provider** or **peer** routes
{: .prompt-info}

**Sibling-to-sibling** relationship translates into the following export policy rules:

> In exchanging routing information **with** a **sibling**, an **AS** can **export** **its** routes **and** routes of **its** **customers**, and **as** **well** **as** its **provider** or **peer** routes
{: .prompt-info}

With that, we can formally define the transit property

> **Transit Property**
>
> AS $u$ transits traffic for AS $v$ if and only if AS $u$ transits some of its provider or peer routes to AS $v$.
>
> - AS $u$ is a **provider** of AS $v$ *iff* $u$ **transits** traffic for $v$ and $v$ **does not** transit traffic for $u$
> - AS $u$ and $v$ have a **peering** relationship *iff* **neither** $u$ **transits** traffic for $v$ nor $v$ transits traffic for $u$
> - AS $u$ and $v$ have a **sibling** relationship *iff* **both** $u$ **transits** traffic for $v$ and $v$ transits traffic for $u$
{: .prompt-tip}

Gao-Rexford guidelines provide us with an important notion: **valley-free paths**

> **Valley-free paths**
>
> **After** traversing a provider-to-customer or peer-to-peer edge, the AS path **can not traverse** a customer-to-provider or peer-to-peer edge.
>
> a.k.a.: *after you go down, you can't go up or stay at the same level; you can only keep going down*
{: .prompt-warning}

*If all ASes set their export policies according to the selective export rule, then the AS path in any BGP routing table entry is valley-free.*

Formally, an AS path is valley-free if and only if the following conditions hold true:

1. A provider-to-customer edge can be followed by only provider-to-customer or sibling-to-sibling edges
2. A peer-to-peer edge can be followed by only customer-to-provider or sibling-to-sibling edges

The valley-free property enables us to identify patterns in observable AS-PATHs.

### Downhill and uphill paths

> **Downhill** path:
>
> A sequence of **edges** that are either **provider-to-customer** or **sibling-to-sibling** edges
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116135444.png){: w="50%"}

> **Uphill** path:
>
> A sequence of **edges** that are either **customer-to-provider** or **sibling-to-sibling** edges
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116135510.png){: w="50%"}

An AS path of a BGP routing table entry has one of the following patterns:

1. an **uphill** path
2. a **downhill** path
3. an **uphill** path followed by a **downhill** path
4. an **uphill** path followed by a **peer-to-peer** edge
5. a **peer-to-peer** edge followed by a **downhill** path
6. an **uphill** path followed by a **peer-to-peer** edge, which is followed by a **downhill** path

This implies that an AS path can be partitioned into either

- The **uphill** path, the **peer-to-peer** edge, and the **downhill** path in order
- The **uphill** path and the **downhill** path in order

**Top** providers are the **most powerful** ASes **within** the uphill (or downhill) **path** in which they appear.

- The uphill top provider is the last AS in the uphill path in which it appears.
- The downhill top provider is the first AS in the downhill path in which it appears

### Metrics

We need a metric to act as a proxy for business power. For this we make two **assumptions**:

1. AS **business** **power**: a provider typically has a **larger** geographical **size** than its customer does
2. The **power metric**: the **geographical** **size** of an AS is typically **proportional** to its **degree** in the AS **graph**

This metric leads to the following chain of reasoning:

> Given
>
> - the uphill (or downhill) top provider of an AS path should be the AS that has the highest degree among all ASes in its uphill (or downhill) path and that
> - The top provider of an AS path is the AS that has a higher degree between the uphill and downhill top provider
> - The top provider of an AS path is the AS that has the highest degree among all ASes in the AS path
{: .prompt-tip}

### Algorithm for inferring provider-customer and sibling relationships

Input: BGP routing tables Output: Annotated AS graph G

- **Phase 1**: **Compute** the **degree** for each AS

```plaintext
For each as_path(u1, u2, ..., un) in routing tables,
    For each i = 1, ..., n - 1,
        neighbor[ui] = neighbor[ui] ∪ {ui+1}
        neighbor[ui+1] = neighbor[ui+1] ∪ {ui}

For each AS u,
    degree[u] = |neighbor[u]|
```

> `neighbor[ui]`
>
> - The set of neighbor ASes for ui
>
> `⎮neighbor[ui]|`
>
> - The degree or number of neighbors for ui

- **Phase 2**: **Parse AS path** to initialize consecutive AS pair’s transit relationship

```plaintext
For each as_path(u1, u2, ..., un) in routing tables,
    find the smallest j such that degree[uj] = max1 ≤ i ≤ n degree[ui]
for i = 1, ..., j - 1,
    transit[ui, ui+1] = 1
for i = j, ..., n - 1,
    transit[ui+1, ui] = 1
```

> **Transit** flag for the directed edge
>
> - An **indication** that the edge has been **traversed** as transit in the **given** **direction**

- **Phase 3**: Assign relationships to AS pairs

```plaintext
For each as_path(u1, u2, ..., un) in routing tables,
  for i = 1, ..., n - 1,
    if transit[ui, ui+1] = 1 and transit[ui+1, ui] = 1
      edge[ui, ui+1] = sibling-to-sibling
    else if transit[ui+1, ui] = 1
      edge[ui, ui+1] = provider-to-customer
    else if transit[ui, ui+1] = 1
      edge[ui, ui+1] = customer-to-provider
```

> **Sibling-to-sibling**
>
> - An edge **flagged** with transit for **both** directions.
>
> **Customer-to-provider**
>
> - An edge **flagged** with transit for a **single** direction.

### Algorithm for inferring peering relationships

Input: BGP routing tables Output: Annotated AS graph G

1. Use the initial algorithm to coarsely classify AS pairs into provider-customer or sibling relationships
   1. Find not peering edges
2. Identify AS pairs that can not have a peering relationship
   1. Smaller degree edge is also not peering (40 > 10) as we can not have two consecutive peer-to-peer edges
3. Assign peering relationships to AS pairs
      1. Ultimately, if the degrees of two neighboring ASes are within a certain ratio (R), and no path provides a counter-example for their non-peering, we deem that relationship peer-to-peer

## Localize performance issues to specific links

> Some links in the Internet are sometimes **lossy**: their loss **rate** **exceeds** some given **threshold**

End-user **traffic** flows along **paths**: a path is a sequence of links between a pair of end-users

During a time interval, a path is **"lossy"** iff it has $≥1$ "lossy links". **All** other paths are "non-lossy".
Upon experiencing **poor** path **performance**, **how** can end-users **locate** which links are the **culprit**?
Network performance **tomography** **infers** link **performance** **from** the network **topology** and path performance.

![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116143149.png){: w="50%"}

We will focus on inferring **two** link performance **properties**:

1. **Probability** of a link being non-lossy
2. Link **Neutrality**

> **Neutral Link**
>
> A link is **neutral** iff it treats "the **same**" **traffic** on **different** paths. Here, "the same" refers to the probability of the link being non-lossy.
{: .prompt-tip}

### Example

Consider a **simple** topology, with $3$ end-users, $1$ switch/router in the middle, $3$ links, and $2$ paths.
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116143845.png){: w="30%"}

During a time interval, a link is non-lossy iff its loss rate is $<1\%$, i.e., the link delivers $≥99\%$ of the packets that arrive at this link to the next link.

Assume that **all** links are **always** **non-lossy** ***except $l_C$***, which is lossy (loss rate $≥1%$) with probability (w.p.) $0.5$

### Inference

How do we infer for each link the probability of being non-lossy from the network topology and path measurements? The key idea is to relate the knowns (path performance) to the unknowns (link
performance) through a system of equations.

1. We **estimate** the path **performance**, which is the probability of the path being non-lossy
   1. During a time interval, we measure the path loss rate the path is "non-lossy" iff "loss rate < threshold"
   2. ideally, we must set the threshold so that the path is non-lossy iff all its links are non-lossy
   3. In practice, we can set the threshold to only guarantee that "if the path is lossy, ≥ 1 of its links is lossy"
   4. To achieve that, we set the threshold to the maximum loss rate that the path would experience if all of its links were non-lossy
2. We **measure** the path **performance**, which is the probability of the path being non-lossy
   1. Estimate it as the fraction of time intervals during which the path is non-lossy
   1. We send S packets over p1, split the measurement time into intervals, and check for what fraction of them the path is non-lossy
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116144228.png){: w="50%"}

3. We **build** a **system** of equations which **connects** **path** **performance** **to** the performance of its **links**
     1. Here is the equation we can write for p1:
    ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116144320.png){: w="50%"}
     2. And here is the equation for p2:
    ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116144336.png){: w="50%"}
    ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116144349.png){: w="50%"}

4. We **solve** the system of equations using linear algebra
   1. **Not** full-rank: only 2 equations for 3 unknowns, so **multiple** solutions and picking a realistic one may **not** be easy
   2. **Considering** **only** the performance of **individual** paths is **not** **enough** to create a full-rank system of equations

We need more information to further constrain the system’s

> Solution: use the performance correlation among multiple paths
{: .prompt-tip}

So far, we haven’t used how often both p1 and p2 are non-loss.
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116144554.png){: w="50%"}

We **also** write **equations** for the performance of:

- "path **pairs**" which refer to two paths
- "path **sets**" which refer to a set of one or more paths

During a time interval,

- a path **pair** is "**non**-lossy" iff **both** of its paths **are** **non**-lossy
- a path **set** is "**non**-lossy" iff **all** of its paths **are** **non**-lossy

> Revised: We build a system of equations by writing equations for the performance of pathsets

Here, additionally to paths, there is only path pair {p12} and we can write the following equation for it: ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116150814.png){: w="50%"}

We estimate the probability of a path pair being non-lossy as the fraction of time intervals where both paths are non-lossy.
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151012.png){: w="50%"}

$$P(p_1\text{ non-lossy}) = 0.5\rightarrow Y_1=\log(0.5)$$

$$P(p_2 \text{ non-lossy}) = 0.5\rightarrow Y_2=\log(0.5)$$

$$P(p_{12} \text{ non-lossy}) = 0.5\rightarrow Y_{12}=\log(0.5)$$

This system of equations is full-rank so solving it yields a unique solution.
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151045.png){: w="25%"}
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151055.png){: w="25%"}

Since $X_1 = X_2= 0$ and $X_C = \log(0.5) < 0$, we correctly infer that $l_C$ is the lossy link

### Assumptions

This system of equations relies on several assumptions

| Assumption | Description |
| --- | -- |
|Stationarity| the **loss** behavior of a link is the **same** over time; we use a **single** variable to capture whether a link  <br> is lossy|
| Neutrality | the **loss** behavior of a link is the **same** for **all** paths **crossing** it for each link; we used the **same** <br> variable **across** **all** equations |
| Stability | the **paths** **remain** **unchanged** over time; we use a single equation for each path |
| Independence | a **link** is **lossy** **independently** from **other** links; multiplied per-link probabilities to obtain the path <br> probability|
| Separability | a **path** is **non**-lossy **iff** **all** of its links **are** **non**-lossy; on top of the path loss threshold, lossy links <br> must be "severely" lossy   |

Given those **assumptions** and a **full**-rank system of equations, this **tomography** technique infers all lossy links.
Consider the same network as before, but now not only $l_C$ but also $l_1$ is lossy w.p. $0.5$.

We can write the **same** equations as before and **plug** in the **new** path performance **estimates**:
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151351.png){: w="50%"}
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151402.png){: w="50%"}

Since $X_2 = 0$ and $X_1 = X_C = \log(0.5) < 0$, we correctly infer that both links $l_1$ and $l_C$ are lossy.

In this slightly different network, there is no full-rank system as the performance of lC1 can always be attributed to lC2 and vice versa.
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151508.png){: w="40%"}

**Sufficient** conditions for **having** a **full**-rank system of equations:

1. We **include** in the system **an** equation for **each** path **set** (incl. individual paths)
2. Every **two** links are **distinguishable**: they are **traversed** by **different** **sets** of paths

In the **initial** network, we could build a full-rank system because any two links are traversed by different sets of paths:
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151548.png)

## Link Neutrality

Consider another network with 4 links and 3 paths:
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151605.png){: w="40%"}

This is a **non**-neutral network: **all** links are **always** **non**-lossy **except** $l_C$, which is non-neutral and lossy **only** for p2/p3 traffic w.p. $0.5$.

An alternative way to think about this network is to use its neutral-equivalent network, where all links are neutral. ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151656.png) In the neutral-equivalent
network, the non-neutral link lC maps to two links:

- one for the common behavior (lCC)
- and one for the worse effect of lC on p2/p3 (lCA)

Here we are showing a snapshot of the network, during which lC is non-lossy for p1 but lossy for p2/p3 ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116151731.png) In the neutral-equivalent network, lCC is
not lossy but lCA is.

### How do we identify that a certain link is non-neutral from the topology and path measurements?

The key **insight** is that **wrongly** assuming **neutral** links can **lead** to an **unsolvable** system.

- If we use a **different** **variable** to capture **different** link performance, then any system of equations we build is solvable.
- If we build an **unsolvable** system of equations, **then** we **used** the **same** variable for **different** link performance
  - $\rightarrow$ we wrongly assumed as neutral a non-neutral link

The key idea is to assume neutral links and build an unsolvable system that reveals that at least one link is non-neutral.

Our best chance is to write an equation for each path set using more info constrains more the system’s solutions. Still, we cannot always build an unsolvable system a link’s worse effect on a path can be attributed to another link

To identify that a certain link $λ$ is non-neutral, we carefully build the system of equations.

We write equations **only** for **all** path pairs that **share** **only** $λ$ and **all** their **individual** paths by **mapping** $λ$ to a **single** variable and for each path, **all** **other** links **to** a **new** variable

Intuitively,

- only λ assumed neutral => if unsolvable system, only this assumption can be wrong
- different path pairs may yield different solutions for λ => unsolvable system

### Example

![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116152401.png){: w="30%"}

The path pairs that share only $λ = l_C$ are {p1, p2}, {p1, p3}, {p2, p3}, so $\Pi_λ = ((p1), (p2), (p3), (p1, p2), (p1, p3), (p2,
p3))$

We build the following system for $\Pi_λ$:
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116152542.png){: w="50%"}

The following sub-system is unsolvable, hence the overall system as well

![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116152601.png){: w="40%"}
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116152616.png){: w="40%"}

**Since** the system is **unsolvable**, we **correctly** identify that **lC** is **non**-neutral.
