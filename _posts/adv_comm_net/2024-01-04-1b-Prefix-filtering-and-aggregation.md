## Prefix aggregation and filtering

Maintaining **many** forwarding entries is **problematic** for at least 3 reasons:

| Resource        |   Issue                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bandwidth        | Installing many entries in a linecard is slow                                          |
| memory           | Routers linecards have limited (and expensive!) memory banks to hold these entries |
| processing power | It is time-consuming to compute one forwarding entry per destination                |

The **key** idea behind prefix aggregation/filtering is to **leverage** the IP addresses **hierarchy**. A **child** prefix can be **filtered** whenever it **shares** the **same** output **interface** as its **parent**.

We can apply prefix aggregation/filtering either:

- locally, at the FIB-level, targeting only **one** FIB
  - router-level gain
  - short term
- or globally, at the RIB-level
  - network-level gain
  - long term

One can identify up to **4** **local** aggregation/filtering **strategies**:

The first 2 strategies are **simple** and preserve **strong** forwarding **consistency**.

1. **Strong** forwarding consistency **mandates** **identical** forwarding **behaviour** for **all** packets.
2. The **longest**-prefix lookup of **any** destination that appears in the **original** FIB **should** return the **same** next-hop **before and after** aggregation.

> Any **non**-routable destination by the original FIB should **not** be routable after aggregation.
>
> - Packets that were dropped initially will also be dropped after aggregation

**Weak** forwarding consistency **mandates** **identical** forwarding **behaviour** ***only*** for **routable** packets. The **longest**-prefix lookup of any destination that appears in the **original** FIB **should** return the **same** next-hop before and after aggregation.

> **Non**-routable destination by the original FIB ***may*** become routable after aggregation.

### Optimal Routing Table Constructor (ORTC)

**ORTC** is an **optimal** FIB aggregation **algorithm**: its **output** has the **smallest** number of prefixes **possible**.

ORTC **guarantees** **strong** forwarding consistency: it guarantees **identical** forwarding decisions for **any** packet.

ORTC **relies** upon **subnetting** and **supernetting** applied to a **binary** tree representation of the **FIB**
![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-03%20at%2023.01.34.png){: width="50%"}

ORTC performs $3$ consecutive tree traversals, each with a distinct goal.

| Pass    | goal             | tree traversal                 |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| pass #1 | normalization    | pre-order, from the root down  |
| pass #2 | next-hop ranking | post-order, from the leaves up |
| pass #3 | prefix filtering | pre-order, from the root down  |

The **first** pass **normalizes** the tree by **fully** expanding it, ensuring **each** node has **either** **$0$** or **$2$** children.

![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-03%20at%2023.07.38.png){: width="50%"}

The second pass calculates the most common next-hops from the bottom up, by merging them according to the following logic.

![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-03%20at%2023.08.26.png)

Namely, return the common elements if any, otherwise return the union.

![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-03%20at%2023.12.12.png){: width="50%"}

The third pass moves down the tree, selecting next-hops and eliminating redundant routes.

> ORTC is **optimal** but comes with **tradeoffs** when it comes to updating the compressed FIB.

> ORTC does **not** support **update** operations to the **aggregated** FIB. The aggregated FIB **must** be **recomputed** upon each **update**.

#### Net result

**Even** if the cost is **linear** in the number of entries, it can still take **hundreds** of ms to update a table.

The **effectiveness** of prefix aggregation **varies** on a per-router basis.

The aggregation **effectiveness** **depends** on:

- **how** prefixes are **distributed** over the next-hops
  - The **fewer** neighbours a router has, the **better** aggregation it may achieve
  - If **all** prefixes **share** the same next-hop, **aggregation** is **maximised**
- how "aggregatable" prefixes are.

Prefix aggregation does **not** come for **free** **computationally** and therefore time-wise, **both** at the beginning and whenever there is an update.

### DRAGON

DRAGON is a **distributed** route-**aggregation** **technique** where routers "think globally, but act locally".

The main result is that by **comparing** routes for different prefixes, a router can **locally** compute **which** routes it can filter and not export while **preserving** routing and forwarding **decisions** **globally**.

When a router **filters** `q`, it does **not** create any forwarding **entry** for `q` and does **not** export `q` to any neighbor.

DRAGON routers **propagate** **more**-specific prefixes only in a **small** vicinity of their origins AS. Packets are **forwarded** according to **increasingly** **more**-specific **prefixes** as they reach the **destination**.

DRAGON **guarantees** **network-wide** routing and/or forwarding **consistency** *post*-filtering.

All PR nodes filtering is a Nash Equilibrium.

**Any** node has $2$ incentives to filter `q`-routes:

- retrieve a **better** route to **forward** traffic
- gain **space** in its routing and forwarding **tables**

with **no** node having a **unilateral** incentive to **move** away.

#### Simple route consistent algorithm

Considering a node $u$, a child prefix $q$, its parent prefix $p$,

> **Algorithm**
>
> If $u$ is not the destination for $q$ and If elected $q$-route $â‰¥$ elected $p$-route then $u$ filters $q$-routes
{: .prompt-info}

![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-03%20at%2023.45.16.png){: width="50%"}

DRAGON relies on **isotonicity**, a property which characterizes the **combined** policies of $2$ neighbors.

> ***Isotonicity***
>
> If an AS $u$ prefers one route over another, a neighboring AS does not have the opposite preference.
>
> It is required for optimality, not correctness.
{: .prompt-tip}

DRAGON shows **extremely** good performance on **inferred** Internet **topologies**:

- Between 50% and 80% of the prefixes can be filtered on the vast majority of the nodes
- Convergence **time** can be **reduced** as much as $8$ times with $73\%$ of the prefixes seeing an improvement
- **Good** filtering **efficiency** is quickly reached: $90\%$ of ASes **filter** prefixes when $100$ ASes deploy DRAGON

DRAGON node can **automatically** introduce **aggregation** prefix to **filter** prefixes **without** parent.

- A node can **autonomously** announce **aggregation** prefixes based on **local** computation and **preserving** **consistency**.
- Routing system **self**-organizes itself in case of **conflict** when **more** than $1$ node announce the **same** parent prefix
- **Number** of aggregation prefixes introduced can be tuned
  - e.g., maximum prefix length or minimum number of covered children
