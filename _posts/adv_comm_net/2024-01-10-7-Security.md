Now Network properties are successfully verified. But, are users reaching the correct website? Or... do they even reach the website?

It’s likely due to a network attack that is causing failures! Network attacks are very common nowadays and they're affecting many critical Internet services.

In this chapter, we will cover three important aspects in network security:

1. **Modelling** network **systems**
2. **Finding** network **threats**
3. **Addressing** network **threats**

## Modelling

We need to identify what the system consists of.

- What are the **nodes**? Identifying components of interest
- What are the **connectivities**? Indicate the protocols between nodes
- What are the **trust** **boundaries**? Define who controls what

### Example

|The **nodes**:| ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175352.png)| ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175500.png)|
|The **connectivities**: | ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175423.png) |![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175508.png)|
|The **trust boundaries**:| ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175438.png) | ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175515.png)|

### Tips

A few tips when modelling networked systems:

- Try to **model all components**
  - **Simplification** is often needed for complex systems though
- Try to **model** the **entire** **stack** of protocols
  - Threats may happen "**cross**-layer"
- Try to **model** **different** **levels** of trust boundaries
  - Different components usually don’t have the same privilege ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175613.png)

## Finding threats

We will try to find threats with the **STRIDE** methodology

### STRIDE

- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

Let’s assume no threats within AS30
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175756.png){: width="40%"}

#### Spoofing threats

Can **BGP** messages sent to AS30 be **spoofed** with AS10’s router address?

> Hint: BGP messages are sent over TCP!

**YES**! TCP sequence number attack!

> May **not** be a **concern** nowadays though

#### Tampering threats

Can **BGP** **messages** sent to AS30 be added/**modified**/removed/replayed?
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175904.png){: width="40%"}

**YES**! By MitM attackers

> Getting in the middle is **difficult** in **practice**

#### Repudiation threats

> Claiming **you** were **not** **responsible** for something.
{: .prompt-info}

Can AS20 **propagate** a **fake** path (e.g., [10 20]) to AS30 and deny it?

**YES**! The path **may** actually exist! Repudiation usually appears in **post-mortem**.

#### Information disclosure threats

> **Exposing** information to **unauthorized** people.
{: .prompt-info}

Can AS20 **learn** the business **relationship** between A10 and AS30?
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116180025.png){: width="40%"}
**YES**! But Relationship inference may be imperfect.

#### Denial of Service threats

> Absorbing resources needed to provide service.
{: .prompt-info}

Can AS20 launch denial-of-service attacks against AS30’s router?
![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116180049.png){: width="40%"}

**YES**! By **flooding** BGP messages! Or in many other ways.

#### Elevation of Privilege threats

> Allowing someone to **do** something **without** authorization.
{: .prompt-info}

Can AS20 advertise prefixes belong to AS10?

**YES**! Prefix **ownership** is **not** **verified**!

> BGP hijacks are very common nowadays
{: .prompt-danger}

### Tips

- Start with external entities outside of trust boundaries
  - More controlled = Less dangerous
- Include (seemingly) uninterested threats
  - More comprehensive = Less dangerous
- Focus on feasible threats
  - Less practical = Less dangerous

## Mitigations

To address an identified network threat, we first decide the desired action.

- **Mitigation**
  - Make it **harder** to take **advantage** of a threat
  - e.g., RPKI to mitigate BGP hijacks
- **Elimination**
  - **Remove** exploited features
  - e.g., no BGP messages = no hijack (naively)
  - Also damage benign use cases
- **Transferring**
  - Let someone else **handle** the risk
  - e.g., let firewall filter excessive messages
  - **Risks** are **not** **transferable**
- **Accepting**
  - **Ignore** the **impractical** threats
    - e.g., DoS by physically destroying routers
  - Risks are underestimated

Mitigation is usually the best option.

### Mitigation techniques against threats found by applying STRIDE

| Problem                 | Solution                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Spoofing                | Authentication (IPSec, DNSSEC, PKIs) |
| Tampering               | Integrity                            |
| Repudiation             | Logging                              |
| Information Disclosure  | Confidentiality (encryption)         |
| Denial of Service       | Availability (filters, throttling)   |
| Elevation of Privileges | Authorization (access control)       |

### Tips

- **Validate** that **threats** are **addressed**
  - Perform a QA process to confirm
- Try to **predict** adversary’s **moves** **against** **mitigations**
  - Involve economic advantages in arms races
- Update model in an iterative process
  - New mitigation components may change the model

## DDoS Attacks

DDoS attacks:

- use different sources (e.g., botnets) of traffic
- exhaust network resources (e.g., devices, links)
- affect many (if not all) networked systems

### Common DDoS attack types

| Type        | Unit  | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Volumetric  | `bps` | Sending massive traffic to create congestion e.g., **DNS** amplification |
| Protocol    | `pps` | Exploiting weaknesses of the network protocols e.g., **SYN** flood       |
| Application | `rps` | Exploiting weaknesses of targeted applications e.g., **HTTP** flood      |

DDoS attacks always become more threatening In 2023, Google mitigated $398$ Mrps.

## Pulse-wave DDoS attacks

A naïve DDoS defense: ![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185631.png){: width="50%"}

Challenges:

1. Short pulses: controller may **not** react in time
2. Unknown attack vectors: unsupervision leads to misclassification

ACC-Turbo’s solutions:

1. infer attacks in the data plane
2. de-prioritize (not drop) clustered traffic

### ACC-Turbo’s design

![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185728.png)

#### Clustering packets

Map each arriving packet to the closest cluster

1. Represent packets by points in the header space![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185755.png){: width="40%"}
2. Represent clusters using registers/bloom filters![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185820.png){: width="40%"}
3. Use Manhattan distance for easy implementation![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185831.png){: width="40%"}

#### Controlling clustered packets

De-prioritizing malicious clusters via scheduling.

![shutup](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185902.png){: width="40%"}

- Exact cluster statistics
  - e.g., rate, size from data plane
- Assess clusters
  - e.g., small clusters with higher rate are more malicious
- Synthesize scheduling policy
  - Deprioritize most malicious clusters

#### Results

ACC-Turbo mitigates pulse-wave DDoS attacks effectively:
