Now Network properties are successfully verified. But, are users reaching the correct website? Or... do they even reach the website? ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116170312.png) It’s likely due to a network attack that is causing failures! Network attacks are very common nowadays and they're affecting many critical Internet services.

In this chapter, we will cover three important aspects in network security:

1. Modelling network systems
2. Finding network threats
3. Addressing network threats

# Modelling

We need to identify what the system consists of.

- What are the nodes? Identifying components of interest
- What are the connectivities? Indicate the protocols between nodes
- What are the trust boundaries? Define who controls what

## Example

The nodes: ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175352.png) ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175500.png)

The connectivities: ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175423.png) ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175508.png)

The trust boundaries: ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175438.png) ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175515.png)

## Tips

A few tips when modelling networked systems:

- Try to model all components
  - Simplification is often needed for complex systems though
- Try to model the entire stack of protocols
  - Threats may happen “cross-layer”
- Try to model different levels of trust boundaries
  - Different components usually don’t have the same privilege ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175613.png)

# Finding threats

We will try to find threats with the STRIDE methodology

## STRIDE

STRIDE

- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information disclosure - Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

Let’s assume no threats within AS30 ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175756.png)

### Spoofing threats

Can BGP messages sent to AS30 be spoofed with AS10’s router address?

> Hint: BGP messages are sent over TCP!

YES! TCP sequence number attack!

> May not be a concern nowadays though

### Tampering threats

Can BGP messages sent to AS30 be added/modified/removed/replayed? YES! By MitM attackers

> Getting in the middle is difficult in practice

![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116175904.png)

### Repudiation threats

Claiming you were not responsible for something.

Can AS20 propagate a fake path (e.g., [10 20]) to AS30 and deny it? YES! The path may actually exist! Repudiation usually appears in post-mortem

### Information disclosure threats

Exposing information to unauthorised people. Can AS20 learn the business relationship between A10 and AS30? ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116180025.png) YES! But Relationship inference may be imperfect.

### Denial of Service threats

Absorbing resources needed to provide service.

Can AS20 launch denial-of-service attacks against AS30’s router? ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116180049.png)

YES! By flooding BGP messages! Or by many other ways.

### Elevation of Privilege threats

Allowing someone to do something without authorisation.

Can AS20 advertise prefixes belong to AS10? YES! Prefix ownership is not verified!

> BGP hijacks are very common nowadays

## Tips

- Start with external entities outside of trust boundaries
  - More controlled = Less dangerous
- Include (seemingly) uninterested threats
  - More comprehensive = Less dangerous
- Focus on feasible threats
  - Less practical = Less dangerous

# Mitigations

To address an identified network threat, we first decide the desired action.

- Mitigation
  - Make it harder to take advantage of a threat
  - e.g., RPKI to mitigate BGP hijacks
- Elimination
  - Remove exploited features
  - e.g., no BGP messages = no hijack (naively)
  - Also damage benign use cases
- Transferring
  - Let someone else handle the risk
  - e.g., let firewall filter excessive messages
  - Risks are not transferable
- Accepting
  - Ignore the impractical threats
  - e.g., DoS by physically destroying routers
  - Risks are underestimated

Mitigation is usually the best option.

## Mitigation techniques against threats found by applying STRIDE

| Problem                 | Solution                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Spoofing                | Authentication (IPSec, DNSSEC, PKIs) |
| Tampering               | Integrity                            |
| Repudiation             | Logging                              |
| Information Disclosure  | Confidentiality (encryption)         |
| Denial of Service       | Availability (filters, throttling)   |
| Elevation of Privileges | Authorisation (access control)       |

## Tips

- Validate that threats are addressed
  - Perform a QA process to confirm
- Try to predict adversary’s moves against mitigations
  - Involve economic advantages in arms races
- Update model in an iterative processs
  - New mitigation components may change the model

# DDoS Attacks

DDoS attacks:

- use different sources (e.g., botnets) of traffic
- exhaust network resources (e.g., devices, links)
- affect many (if not all) networked systems

## Common DDoS attack types

| Type        | Unit  | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Volumetric  | `bps` | Sending massive traffic to create congestion e.g., DNS amplification |
| Protocol    | `pps` | Exploiting weaknesses of the network protocols e.g., SYN flood       |
| Application | `rps` | Exploiting weaknesses of targeted applications e.g., HTTP flood      |

DDoS attacks always become more threatening In 2023, Google mitigated 398 Mrps. ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116184629.png) ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116184647.png)

# Pulse-wave DDoS attacks

A naïve DDoS defense: ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185631.png)

Challenges:

1. Short pulses: controller may not react in time
2. Unknown attack vectors: unsupervision leads to misclasification

ACC-Turbo’s solutions:]

1. infer attacks in the data plane
2. deprioritize (not drop) clustered traffic

## ACC-Turbo’s design

![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185728.png)

### Clustering packets

Map each arriving packet to the closest cluster

1. Represent packets by points in the header space![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185755.png)
2. Represent clusters using registers/bloom filters![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185820.png)
3. Use Manhattan distance for easy implementation![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185831.png)

### Controlling clustered packets

Deprioritising malicious clusters via scheduling.

![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185902.png)

- Exact cluster statistics
  - e.g., rate, size from data plane
- Assess clusters
  - e.g., small clusters with higher rate are more malicious
- Synthesize scheduling policy
  - Deprioritize most malicious clusters

### Results

ACC-Turbo mitigates pulse-wave DDoS attacks effectively: ![](/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020240116185941.png)
