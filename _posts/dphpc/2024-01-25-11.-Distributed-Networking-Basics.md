Transfer time

$$𝑇(𝑠) = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑠$$

- $𝛼$ = startup time (latency)
- $𝛽$ = cost per byte (bandwidth = $1/𝛽$)

Effective bandwidth of a transfer:

- $E(𝑠) = 𝑠 / 𝑇(𝑠)$

As s increases, the effective bandwidth approaches $1/𝛽$ asymptotically

- Convergence rate depends on α
- $𝑠_{1/2} = 𝛼/𝛽$

Assuming **no** pipelining (new messages can only be **issued** from a process **after all arrived**)

- **Two** messages of size 𝑠 between two processes cost $2(𝛼 + 𝑠𝛽)$
- Somewhat **unrealistic** (networks pipeline) but simple for now – we will lift this later!

## Bandwidth vs. Latency

$𝑠_{1/2} = 𝛼/𝛽$ is often used to **distinguish** **bandwidth**- and **latency**-**bound** **messages**

- $𝑠_{1/2} $ is in the order of kilobytes on real systems ![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-11%20at%2017.19.49.png)

### Example: simplest linear broadcast

- One process has a data item to be distributed to all processes

> Linearly broadcasting $s$ bytes among $P$ processes:
>
> $$ 𝑇 (𝑠) = (P − 1) ⋅ (𝛼 + 𝛽𝑠) = O(P)$$

### k-ary Tree Broadcast

**Origin** process is the **root** of the tree, **passes** messages to $k$ neighbors which pass them on

- $k=2 \rightarrow$ **binary** tree

What is the **broadcast time** in the simple latency/bandwidth model?

- $𝑇 (𝑠) ≈ \log_𝑘P ⋅ 𝑘(𝛼 + 𝛽𝑠)$ (for fixed k)

#### What is the optimal $k$?

$$0 = \frac {k \ln P} {\ln k} \frac {d} {dk} = \frac {\ln P \ln k - \ln P} {\ln^2 k} \rightarrow k = e \approx 2.71 $$

> Independent of $P, \alpha, \beta, s$?

### Faster Trees?

Can we broadcast **faster** than in a **ternary** tree?

- **Yes**, because each non-leaf processor is idle after sending three messages!
- Those **processors could keep sending**!
- Result is a k-nomial tree
- For $k=2$, it’s a binomial tree

What about the **runtime**?

- $𝑇 (𝑠) ≈ \log_𝑘P ⋅ 𝑘(𝛼 + 𝛽𝑠)=O(\log P)$

What is the optimal $k$ here?

- $T(s) \frac d {dk}$ is monotonically increasing for $k>1$, thus $k_{opt}=2$

Can we broadcast faster than in a k-nomial tree?

- $O(log P)$ is asymptotically optimal for $s=1$
- But what about large $s$?

### Very Large Message Broadcast

Extreme case (P small, s large): simple pipeline

- Split message into $P$ segments
- Send segments from $PE_i$ to $PE_{i+1}$
- What is the runtime?
  $T(s) = (P − 1)(\alpha + \frac s P \beta)$

Compare $2$-nomial tree with simple pipeline for $α=10, β=1, P=4, s=10^6$

- $2,000,020$ vs. $1,000,030$

Can we do better for given $α, β, P, s$?

- Yes, mix those algorithms – quite complex!

### What is a simple lower bound on the broadcast time?

$$T_{BC} \geq\min\{\lceil\log_2(P)\rceil\alpha,s\beta\}$$

How **close** are the **binomial** tree for **small** messages and the pipeline for large messages (approximately)?

- Binary tree is a factor of $\log_2(P)$ **slower** in **bandwidth**
- Pipeline is a factor of $\frac P{\log_2(P)}$ **slower** in **latency**

What can we do for **intermediate** message sizes?

- **Combine** pipeline and tree → pipelined tree

What is the **runtime** of the pipelined binary tree algorithm?

$$ T \approx (\frac s z \lceil \log_2 P\rceil-2)\cdot2\cdot(\alpha +z\beta) $$

What is the **optimal** $z$?

 $$z_{opt}=\sqrt{\frac {\alpha s} {\beta(\lceil \log_2P \rceil-2)}}$$

### Towards an Optimal Algorithm

What is the complexity of the pipelined tree with $z_{opt}$ for small $s$, large $P$ and for large $s$, constant $P$?

- Small messages, large $P$: $s=1; z=1$ $(s≤z)$, will give $O(\log P)$
- Large messages, constant $P$: assume $α, β, P$ constant, will give asymptotically $O(sβ)$

Asymptotically optimal for large P and s but bandwidth is off by a factor of 2! Why?

***Intuition***:

- In a binomial tree, all leaves ($P/2$) only receive data and never send
  - results in wasted bandwidth
- Send along two simultaneous binary trees where the leaves of one tree are inner nodes of the other
- Construction needs to avoid endpoint congestion

## The LogP Model

Defined by 4 parameters:

- **L**: an **upper** bound on the **latency**, or delay, incurred in **communicating** a **message** containing a word (or small number of words) **from** its **source** module **to** its **target** module.
- **o**: the **overhead**, defined as the **length of time** that a processor is **engaged** in the transmission or reception of each message; **during** this time, the processor **cannot perform** other operations.
- **g**: the **gap**, defined as the **minimum time interval between consecutive message** transmissions or consecutive message receptions at a processor. The reciprocal of **g** corresponds to the available per-processor communication bandwidth.
- **P**: the **number of processor**/memory **modules**.

> We assume unit time for local operations and call it a cycle.

### Examples

|||
|---|---|
| Sending a single message| $T = 2o+L$|
|Ping-Pong Round-Trip| $T_{RTT} = 4o+2L$|
|Transmitting n messages|$T(n) = L+(n-1)\cdot\max(g, o) + 2o$|

### Simplifications

1. $o > g$ on some machines
   - $g$ can be **ignored** (eliminates max() terms)
   - be **careful** with multi-core!
2. Offloading networks might have **very low** $o$
   - Can be **ignored** (not yet but hopefully soon)
3. $L$ might be **ignored** **for long message streams**
   - **If** they are **pipelined**
4. **Account** $g$ **also** for the **first** message
   - Eliminates $-1$

### Benefits over Latency/Bandwidth Model

Models pipelining

- $\frac L g$ messages can be “in flight”
- Captures state of the art (cf. TCP windows)

Models computation/communication overlap

- Asynchronous algorithms

Models endpoint congestion/overload

- Benefits balanced algorithms

### Example: Broadcasts

What is the LogP running time for a linear broadcast of a single packet?

$$T_{lin} = L + (P-2) * \max(o,g) + 2o$$

----

Approximate the LogP runtime for a binary-tree broadcast of a single packet?

$$T_{bin} ≤ \log_2P * (L + \max(o,g) + 2o)$$

----

Approximate the LogP runtime for an k-ary-tree broadcast of a single packet?

$$T_{k-n} ≤ \log_kP * (L + (k-1)\max(o,g) + 2o)$$

----

Approximate the LogP runtime for a binomial tree broadcast of a single packet (assume $L> g$!)?

$$T_{bin} ≤ \log_2P * (L + 2o)$$

----

Approximate the LogP runtime for a k-nomial tree broadcast of a single packet?

$$T_{k-n} ≤ \log_kP * (L + (k-2)\max(o,g) + 2o)$$

----

What is the optimal $k$ (assume $o>g$)?

- Derive by $k$: $0 = o * \ln(k_{opt}) – L/k_{opt} + o$ (solve numerically)
  - For larger $L$, $k$ grows and for larger $o$, $k$ shrinks
- Models pipelining capability better than simple model!

----

Can we do better than $k_{opt}$-ary binomial broadcast?

- Problem: fixed $k$ in all stages might not be optimal
- We can construct a schedule for the optimal broadcast in practical settings

#### Optimal Broadcast

Broadcast to $P-1$ processes

- each process who received the value sends it on;
- each process receives exactly once.

![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-11%20at%2018.18.38.png)

#### Optimal Broadcast Runtime

This determines the maximum number of PEs ($P(t)$) that can be reached in time $t$

- $P(t)$ can be computed with a generalized Fibonacci recurrence (assuming $o>g$):

$$P(t)=\begin{cases}
      1: \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \, \,t<2o+L\\
      P(t-o) + P(t-2o-L): t≥2o+L
    \end{cases}$$

  - which can be bounded by
  
  $$2^{\lfloor \frac {t}{L+2o} \rfloor} ≤P(t)≤2^{\lfloor \frac t o \rfloor}$$
