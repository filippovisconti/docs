## Problem: Processor-Memory Bottleneck

## Terminology

Directly mapped cache:

- Cache with `E=1`
- Every block from memory has a unique location in cache

Fully associative cache:

- Cache with `S=1`
- Every block from memory can be mapped to any location in cache
- Expensive to build in practice
- The register file can be viewed as a fully associative cache

LRU Replacement: when selecting which block should be replaced (happens only for E>1), the least recently used one is chosen.

## Types of cache misses

1. Compulsory: occurs on first access to a block
2. Capacity: occurs when the working set is larger than the cache
3. Conflict: occurs when the cache is large enough, but multiple data objects map to the same slot

## Write policies

## Is Coherence Everything?

- Coherence is concerned with behavior of individual locations
- Consider the program (initial X,Y,Z = 0) ![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-05%20at%2019.16.07.png) ![shutup](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-05%20at%2019.16.22.png)

What value will Z on P2 have?

- Y=10 does not need to have completed before X=2 is visible to P2!
- This allows P2 to exit the loop and read Y=0
- This may not be the intent of the programmer!
- This may be due to congestion (imagine X is pushed to a remote cache while Y misses to main memory) and or due to write buffering, or ...

What happens when Y and X are on the same cache line (assume simple MESI and no write buffer)

## For the exercises

Number of sets: `S = cache_size/(cacheline_size*associativity)`

> e.g. 2MiB cache, 64B cacheline, 8-way associative: `S = 2*1024*1024/(64*8) = 4096` e.g. 256B ache, 32B cacheline, 2-way associative: `S = 256/(32*2) = 4`

Number of bits for the offset = `log2(cacheline_size)`

> e.g. 64B cacheline: `log2(64) = 6` e.g. 32B cacheline: `log2(32) = 5`

Number of bits for the set = `log2(number_of_sets)`

Number of bits for the tag = `address_size - offset_size - set_size`

> e.g., 32-bit address, 32B cacheline, 2-way associative: `32 - 5 - 2 = 25` e.g., with a 4KiB memory, 32B cacheline, 2-way associative: `12 - 5 - 2 = 5`
