When talking about work and depth, we assume each loop iteration on a single PE is unit-cost (may contain multiple instructions!)

Given: $n$ values in linked list, looking for sum of all values ![](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-12%20at%2017.36.19.png)

> [!NOTE] Independent Set A set $𝐼 ⊂ 𝑆$ is called an independent set if no two elements in $𝐼$ are connected!

# Reduction on a linked list

## Sequential algorithm

```c
typedef struct elem {
 struct elem *next;
 int val;
} elem;

set S={all elems}
while (S != empty) {
 pick some i ∈ S;
 S = S – i.next;
 i.val += i.next.val;
 i.next = i.next.next;
}
```

## Parallel algorithm

Basically the same algorithm, just working on independent subsets!

```c
set S={all elems}
while (S != empty) {
 pick independent subset I ∈ S;
 for(each 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 do in parallel) {
  S = S – i.next;
  i.val += i.next.val;
  i.next = i.next.next;
 }
}
```

Assuming picking a maximum 𝐼 is free, what are work and depth?

- $𝑊 = 𝑛 − 1, 𝐷 = ⌈\log_2n⌉$

### How to pick the independent set 𝑰?

- That’s now the whole trick!
- It’s simple if all linked values are consecutive in an array – same as “standard” reduction!
  - There, we “compute” (know?) independent sets up-front!

Irregular linked list though?

- Idea 1: find the order of elements → requires parallel prefix sum, D’oh!
- Observation: if we pick $𝐼 > 𝜆|𝑉|$ in each iteration, we finish in logarithmic time!

Symmetry breaking:

- Assume 𝑝 processes work on 𝑝 consecutive nodes
- How to find the independent set?
  - They all look the same (well, only the first and last differ, they have no left/right neighbor)
  - Local decisions cannot be made

Introduce randomness to create local differences!

- Each node tosses a coin → 0 or 1
- Let 𝐼 be the set of nodes such that `v` drew `1` and `v.next` drew `0`!
  - Show that I is indeed independent!
  - What is the probability that 𝑣 ∈ 𝐼? $$P(v \in I)=\frac 1 4$$ ![](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-12%20at%2017.48.14.png)

### Optimizations

As the set shrinks, the random selection will get less efficient

- When 𝑝 is close to $𝑛 ( |𝑆| )$ then most processors will fail to make useful progress
- Switch to a different algorithm: Recursive doubling!

```c
for (i=0; i ≤ ⌈log2𝑛⌉; ++i) {
 for(each elem do in parallel) {
  elem.val += elem.next.val;
  elem.next = elem.next.next;
 }
}
```

Algorithm computes (reverse) prefix sum on the list! Result at original list head is overall sum

What are work and depth?

- $𝑊 = 𝑛⌈\log_2𝑛⌉, 𝐷 = ⌈\log_2n⌉$

# Prefix sum on a linked list

Didn’t we just see it? Yes, but work-inefficient (if $p<<n$)! We extend the randomized symmetry-breaking reduction algorithms

- First step: run the reduction algorithm as before
- Second step: reinsert in reverse order of deletion When reinserting, add the value of their successor. ![](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-12%20at%2017.50.23.png)

How to implement this in practice?

- Either recursion or a stack!

# Nonoblivious graph algorithms - finding connected components

> [!NOTE] Connected Component A connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected by a path and no vertex in the subgraph is connected to any vertices
> outside the subgraph. Each undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ contains one or multiple (at most $|V|$) connected components.

Straight forward and cheap to compute sequentially – question: how?

- Any traversal algorithm in work $𝑂 (𝑉 + 𝐸)$ Seemingly trivial - becomes very interesting in parallel
- Our oblivious semiring-based algorithm was $𝑊 = 𝑂(𝑛^3\log 𝑛), 𝐷 = 𝑂(log^2𝑛)$

FAR from work optimality! Question: can we do better by dropping obliviousness? ![](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-12%20at%2018.31.18.png)

Question is now only about the merging strategy

> A fixpoint algorithm proceeds iteratively and monotonically until it reaches a final state that is not left by iterating further

## Shiloach/Vishkin’s algorithm

Pointer graph/forest:

- Define pointer array 𝑃
  - 𝑃[𝑖] is a pointer from 𝑖 to some other vertex
- We call the graph defined by 𝑃 (excluding self loops) the pointer graph
- During the algorithm, 𝑃[𝑖] forms a forest such that
  - ∀𝑖: 𝑖, 𝑃 𝑖 there exists a path from 𝑖 to 𝑃[𝑖] in the original graph!
- Initially, all `P[i] = i`
- The algorithm will run until each forest is a directed star pointing at the (smallest-id) root of the component

Supervertices:

- Initially, each vertex is its own supervertex
- Supervertices induce a graph - 𝑆𝑖 and 𝑆𝑗 are connected iff ∃ 𝑢, 𝑣 ∈ 𝐸 with 𝑢 ∈ 𝑆𝑖 and 𝑣 ∈ 𝑆𝑗
- A supervertex is represented by its tree in 𝑃

### Key components

Algorithm proceeds in two operations:

- Hook – merge connected supervertices (must be careful to not introduce cycles!)
- Shortcut – turn trees into stars
- Repeat two steps iteratively until fixpoint is reached

Work and depth?

- $𝑊 = 𝑂 (𝑛^2\log 𝑛) , 𝐷 = 𝑂(\log^2𝑛)$ (assuming conflicts are free!)
