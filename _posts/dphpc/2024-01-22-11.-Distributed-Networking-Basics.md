Transfer time $𝑇(𝑠) = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑠$

- $𝛼$ = startup time (latency)
- $𝛽$ = cost per byte (bandwidth=$1/𝛽$)

Effective bandwidth of a transfer:

- $𝐸(𝑠) = 𝑠 / 𝑇(𝑠)$

As s increases, the effective bandwidth approaches $1/𝛽$ asymptotically

- Convergence rate depends on α
- $𝑠_{1/2} = 𝛼/𝛽$

Assuming no pipelining (new messages can only be issued from a process after all arrived)

- Two messages of size 𝑠 between two processes cost $2(𝛼 + 𝑠𝛽)$
- Somewhat unrealistic (networks pipeline) but simple for now – we will lift this later!

# Bandwidth vs. Latency

$𝑠_{1/2} = 𝛼/𝛽$ is often used to distinguish bandwidth- and latency-bound messages

- $𝑠_{1/2} $ is in the order of kilobytes on real systems ![](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-11%20at%2017.19.49.png)

## Example

Simplest linear broadcast

- One process has a data item to be distributed to all processes

Linearly broadcasting s bytes among P processes: $$ 𝑇 (𝑠) = (𝑃 − 1) ⋅ (𝛼 + 𝛽𝑠) = 𝑂(𝑃)$$

## k-ary Tree Broadcast

Origin process is the root of the tree, passes messages to k neighbours which pass them on

- k=2 -> binary tree

What is the broadcast time in the simple latency/bandwidth model?

- $𝑇 (𝑠) ≈ \log_𝑘𝑃 ⋅ 𝑘(𝛼 + 𝛽𝑠)$ (for fixed k) ![](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-11%20at%2017.42.28.png)

## Faster Trees?

Can we broadcast faster than in a ternary tree?

- Yes, because each non-leaf processor is idle after sending three messages!
- Those processors could keep sending!
- Result is a k-nomial tree
- For k=2, it’s a binomial tree

What about the runtime?

- $𝑇 (𝑠) ≈ \log_𝑘𝑃 ⋅ 𝑘(𝛼 + 𝛽𝑠)=O(\log P)$

What is the optimal k here?

- $T(s) d/dk$ is monotonically increasing for k>1, thus $k_{opt}=2$

Can we broadcast faster than in a k-nomial tree?

- $𝑂(log 𝑃)$ is asymptotically optimal for $s=1$
- But what about large $s$?

## Very Large Message Broadcast

Extreme case (P small, s large): simple pipeline

- Split message into P segments
- Send segments from PE i to PE i+1 What is the runtime?
- $𝑇(𝑠) = (𝑃 − 1)(𝛼 + \frac s P 𝛽)$

Compare 2-nomial tree with simple pipeline for $α=10, β=1, P=4, s=10^6$

- 2,000,020 vs. 1,000,030

Can we do better for given $α, β, P, s$?

- Yes, mix those algorithms – quite complex!

## What is a simple lower bound on the broadcast time?

$$T_{BC} \geq\min\{\lceil\log_2(P)\rceil\alpha,s\beta\}$$ How close are the binomial tree for small messages and the pipeline for large messages (approximately)?

- Bin. tree is a factor of log2(P) slower in bandwidth
- Pipeline is a factor of P/log2(P) slower in latency

What can we do for intermediate message sizes?

- Combine pipeline and tree → pipelined tree

What is the runtime of the pipelined binary tree algorithm? $$ T \approx (\frac s z \lceil \log_2 P\rceil-2)\cdot2\cdot(\alpha +z\beta) $$ What is the optimal $z$? $$z_{opt}=\sqrt{\frac {\alpha s} {\beta(\lceil \log_2P \rceil-2)}}$$

## Towards an Optimal Algorithm

What is the complexity of the pipelined tree with zopt for small s, large P and for large s, constant P?

- Small messages, large P: $s=1; z=1$ $(s≤z)$, will give $O(\log P)$
- Large messages, constant P: assume $α, β, P$ constant, will give asymptotically $O(sβ)$

Asymptotically optimal for large P and s but bandwidth is off by a factor of 2! Why? ![](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-11%20at%2018.08.02.png)

# The LogP Model

Defined by four parameters:

- **L**: an upper bound on the latency, or delay, incurred in communicating a message containing a word (or small number of words) from its source module to its target module.
- **o**: the overhead, defined as the length of time that a processor is engaged in the transmission or reception of each message; during this time, the processor cannot perform other operations.
- **g**: the gap, defined as the minimum time interval between consecutive message transmissions or consecutive message receptions at a processor. The reciprocal of g corresponds to the available per-processor communication bandwidth.
- **P**: the number of processor/memory modules. We assume unit time for local operations and call it a cycle. ![](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-11%20at%2018.11.38.png)

## Examples

Sending a single message

- $T = 2o+L$

Ping-Pong Round-Trip

- $T_{RTT} = 4o+2L$

Transmitting n messages

- $T(n) = L+(n-1)\cdot\max(g, o) + 2o$

## Simplifications

o is bigger than g on some machines

- g can be ignored (eliminates max() terms)
- be careful with multicore!

Offloading networks might have very low o

- Can be ignored (not yet but hopefully soon)

L might be ignored for long message streams

- If they are pipelined

Account g also for the first message

- Eliminates "-1"

## Benefits over Latency/Bandwidth Model

Models pipelining

- L/g messages can be “in flight”
- Captures state of the art (cf. TCP windows)

Models computation/communication overlap

- Asynchronous algorithms

Models endpoint congestion/overload

- Benefits balanced algorithms

## Example: Broadcasts

What is the LogP running time for a linear broadcast of a single packet?

- $T_{lin} = L + (P-2) * \max(o,g) + 2o$

Approximate the LogP runtime for a binary-tree broadcast of a single packet?

- $T_{bin} ≤ \log_2P * (L + \max(o,g) + 2o)$

Approximate the LogP runtime for an k-ary-tree broadcast of a single packet?

- $T_{k-n} ≤ \log_kP * (L + (k-1)\max(o,g) + 2o)$

Approximate the LogP runtime for a binomial tree broadcast of a single packet (assume L> g!)?

- $T_{bin} ≤ \log_2P * (L + 2o)$

Approximate the LogP runtime for a k-nomial tree broadcast of a single packet?

- $T_{k-n} ≤ \log_kP * (L + (k-2)\max(o,g) + 2o)$

What is the optimal k (assume o>g)?

- Derive by k: $0 = o * \ln(k_{opt}) – L/k_{opt} + o$ (solve numerically)
  - For larger L, k grows and for larger o, k shrinks
- Models pipelining capability better than simple model!

Can we do better than $k_{opt}$-ary binomial broadcast?

- Problem: fixed k in all stages might not be optimal
- We can construct a schedule for the optimal broadcast in practical settings

### Optimal Broadcast

Broadcast to P-1 processes

- Each process who received the value sends it on;
- each process receives exactly once.

### Optimal Broadcast Runtime

This determines the maximum number of PEs (P(t)) that can be reached in time t

- P(t) can be computed with a generalized Fibonacci recurrence (assuming $o>g$):
