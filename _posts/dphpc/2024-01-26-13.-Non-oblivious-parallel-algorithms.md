When talking about work and depth, we assume each loop iteration on a single PE is unit-cost (may contain multiple instructions!)

Given: $n$ values in linked list, looking for sum of all values ![example](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-12%20at%2017.36.19.png)

## Reduction on a linked list

### Sequential algorithm

```c
typedef struct elem {
    struct elem *next;
    int val;
} elem;

set S={all elems}
while (S != empty) {
    pick some i ∈ S;
    S = S - i.next;
    i.val += i.next.val;
    i.next = i.next.next;
}
```

### Parallel algorithm

Basically the same algorithm, just working on **independent subsets**!

```c
set S={all elems}
while (S != empty) {
    pick independent subset I ∈ S;
    for(each i ∈ I do in parallel) {
        S = S - i.next;
        i.val += i.next.val;
        i.next = i.next.next;
    }
}
```

Assuming picking a maximum $I$ is free, what are **work** and **depth**?

- $W = n − 1$
- $D = ⌈\log_2n⌉$

#### How to pick the independent set 𝑰?

- That’s now the whole trick!
- It’s **simple** if all linked values are **consecutive** in an array – same as “standard” reduction!
  - There, we “compute” (know?) independent sets up-front!

Irregular linked list though?

- Idea 1: **find** the **order** of elements → requires parallel prefix sum, D’oh!
- Observation: if we **pick** $I > \lambda \|V\|$ in each iteration, we **finish** in **logarithmic** time!

Symmetry breaking:

- Assume $p$ processes work on $p$ **consecutive** nodes
- How to **find** the **independent** set?
  - They **all** look the same (well, only the first and last differ, they have no left/right neighbor)
  - **Local** decisions **cannot** be made

Introduce **randomness** to create local differences!

- **Each** node **tosses** a **coin** → 0 or 1
- Let $I$ be the set of nodes such that `v` drew `1` and `v.next` drew `0`!
  - Show that $I$ is indeed independent!
  - What is the probability that $v \in I$?

  $$P(v \in I)=\frac 1 4$$

#### Optimizations

As the set shrinks, the random selection will get less efficient

- When $p$ is **close** to $n ( \|S\| )$ then **most** processors will **fail** to make useful progress
- **Switch** to a different algorithm: *Recursive doubling*!

```c
for (i=0; i ≤ ⌈log2n⌉; ++i) 
    for(each elem do in parallel) {
        elem.val += elem.next.val;
        elem.next = elem.next.next;
    }
```

Algorithm **computes** (reverse) **prefix** **sum** on the list! **Result** at original list **head** is **overall** sum.

What are **work** and **depth**?

- $W = n⌈\log_2n⌉$
- $D = ⌈\log_2n⌉$

## Prefix sum on a linked list

Didn’t we just see it? Yes, but work-inefficient (if $p<<n$)! We extend the randomized symmetry-breaking reduction algorithms

1. **Run** the **reduction** algorithm as before
2. **Reinsert** in **reverse** order of **deletion**
   - When reinserting, add the value of their successor.

![example](/assets/img/ScreenShot%202024-01-12%20at%2017.50.23.png)

How to **implement** this in **practice**?

- Either **recursion** or a **stack**!

## Nonoblivious graph algorithms - finding connected components

> ***Connected Component***
>
> A connected component of an **undirected** graph is a **subgraph** in which **any two vertices are connected by a path** and **no** vertex in the **subgraph** is connected to **any vertices outside the subgraph**.
>
> Each **undirected** graph $G = (V,E)$ **contains one or multiple** (at most $\|V\|$) **connected components**.
{: .prompt-info}

Straightforward and cheap to compute sequentially – question: **how**?

- Any traversal algorithm in work $O (V + E)$
  - Seemingly trivial
  - Becomes very interesting in parallel
- Our oblivious semiring-based algorithm was $W = O(n^3\log n),  D= O(\log^2n)$

FAR from work optimality! Question: can we do better by dropping obliviousness?

### Shiloach/Vishkin’s algorithm

**Pointer graph/forest**:

- Define **pointer** array `P`
  - `P[i]` is a pointer from `i` to some other vertex
- We call the graph defined by `P` (excluding self loops) the pointer graph
- During the algorithm, `P[i]` forms a forest such that
  - $∀i: (i, P_i)$ there exists a path from `i` to `P[i]` in the original graph!

Initially, all `P[i] = i`. The **algorithm** will **run until each forest** is a directed **star** pointing at the (smallest-id) **root** of the component

Supervertices:

- Initially, each vertex is its own supervertex
- Supervertices induce a graph - $S_i$ and $S_j$ are connected iff $∃ u, v ∈ E$ with $u ∈ S_i$ and $v ∈ S_j$
- A supervertex is represented by its tree in P

#### Key components

Algorithm proceeds in two operations:

- **Hook** – *merge connected supervertices* (must be careful to not introduce cycles!)
- **Shortcut** – *turn trees into stars*
- Repeat two steps **iteratively** until **fixpoint** is reached

> A fixpoint algorithm proceeds iteratively and monotonically until it reaches a final state that is not left by iterating further

Work and depth?

- $W = O (n^2\log n) , D = O(\log^2n)$ (assuming conflicts are free!)
